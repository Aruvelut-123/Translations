Translations for PolyMC

To participate in the translation effort, go to [the PolyMC weblate site](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/polymc/polymc) and join our Discord or Matrix community which are listed at [the main repo](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC).
(If you don't have a Weblate account, you can create one using your Facebook, Google, Ubuntu One, OpenSUSE, Fedora, Bitbucket, Github, GitLab, or email.)

You may want to use [POEdit](https://poedit.net/) to work on the translations. PolyMC allows putting a `.po` file in the translations folder and see changes in the application as you translate.
